# nn-c3d
This is my trial project for learning some machine learning tools.
Trains a 3-layer perceptron giving C3D video features for activity recognition (like fine-tuning).
This project is for a my orginal video dataset that is not public.

## Video features
* [C3D](https://github.com/facebook/C3D)

## Tools
* [Chainer](https://github.com/pfnet/chainer)
* [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
